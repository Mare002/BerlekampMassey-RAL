# Berlekamp-Massey Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the **Berlekamp-Massey Algorithm**, which is used to find the minimal linear feedback shift register (LFSR) for a given binary sequence. This algorithm is widely used in coding theory, cryptography, and error correction.

---

## Project Overview

The Berlekamp-Massey Algorithm is a powerful mathematical tool for solving problems in error correction coding and cryptography. It computes the shortest LFSR that generates a given sequence of numbers, which can be used to analyze or generate pseudo-random sequences.

This implementation was developed collaboratively and written entirely in **C++** for high-performance computation.

## Features

- **Efficient Implementation**: Designed for fast computation of the minimal LFSR for input sequences.
- **C++ Based**: Leveraging the performance and flexibility of the C++ programming language.
- **Readable Code**: Organized and documented for easy understanding and modification.
- **Customizable**: Adaptable for different input sequences and applications.
